Deaf students face significant challenges in daily life, including mobility issues, limited access to sign language learning resources, safety concerns, and communication barriers. 
These obstacles affect social interactions, academic performance, and personal safety, as they may struggle to understand spoken language and miss auditory cues like alarms or car horns. 
Additionally, accessible and engaging tools for learning sign language are scarce, and navigating unfamiliar environments can be difficult. 
Our app provides an integrated solution, combining interactive sign language learning, safety alerts, indoor navigation with AR, and a supportive community platform, to enhance the quality of life for deaf students.
